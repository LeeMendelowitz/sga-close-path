// Perform a bounded BFS to collect edges starting from pVertex in direction dir, up to a maximum distance.
// NOTE: This search differs from the search functionality provided in SGSearch.
// Search distance is measured from the end of a vertex:
// |----------> A
//            | 
//            0
//
//          <-----| B
//               |------>   C
// Distance 0 is at the end of the start vertex A
// A vertex reachable from A is measured as the distance between 0 and the start of that vertex.
// B has a negative distance since it overlaps with A.
// C has a positive distance since there a gap between end of A and start of C.

// This version copies StringGraphAttributes from pGraph
// Make a subgraph of nodes that are on gauranteed to be on paths from Vertex pX to pY
// with distance less than maxDistance.
// See description for boundedBFS for how distance is measured.
